# Travis Multirunner

This is a set of scripts designed to help you get up and running multibrowser tests on [travis](http://travis-ci.org). The scripts themselves are designed to be fetched during a travis `before_script` process and used to prepare your environment.

## Usage

Using `travis-multirunner` has never been easier, simply install using:

```
npm install travis-multirunner@latest --save-dev
```

Most of the work will be done for you!  A `.travis.yml` configuration file will be generated from the [`template.yaml`](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/travis-multirunner/blob/master/template.yaml) file in this repo and should allow you to start making use of environment variable driven travis [build matrix](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-configuration/#The-Build-Matrix) builds.

## Contributing

If you want to patch travis-multirunner, here's what you have to do:

- clone this repo
- npm install
- export BROWSER=chrome BVER=stable (or any other combo of your choice).
  This is required for the next steps.
- ./setup.sh
- npm test
- exit the browser started

Make your patches and test them in the usual fashion, and create a pull
request. The pull request will run Travis to verify that your patch works
for all the standard browser combos.

## Prior Art

None of this would have been possible without the docs and code listed below:

- [Automated testing in Travis CI for WebRTC](http://lynckia.com/licode/travis-webrtc.html)

- `.travis-setup.sh` from the [web-animations-js](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js) project

- Travis docs on [GUI and Headless Browsers](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/)
